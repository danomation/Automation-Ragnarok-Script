UI issues fixed! Change made: Adjusted packetversion to work with the default remote client  

# ragnarokonline_oneclick
webclient+server for Ubuntu 22.04. This script does very little but it can make a server in 12 minutes or so. 
It's just a bash that automates installation of several things.  
None of the ragnarok online files are hosted by this github. It is only an automation piece for educational purposes. Please respect copyright laws  

# Instructions:
Fresh Ubuntu 22.04, open root, and type in command:  
1. git clone https://github.com/danomation/ragnarok_script.git && bash ragnarok_script/ragnarok.sh  
2. Wait for server to install 15-20mins then navigate to http:// youriphere/ 
--- 
optional 
3. Add your extracted grf files if you wish. Otherwise from what I understand it will attempt to read from the robrowser website. I cannot supply the data.grf despite my best wishes to :(  
4. Note: If you use your own extracted grf files, add remoteClient:  "http://127.0.0.1/roBrowserLegacy/client in the index.html. Also it must be added to the grf js you upload from the builder website.  

# Known issues:
1. First sign-on you can't make characters or login. 
Solution: shift+F5 to refresh the client and try again
