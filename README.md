# ragnarokonline_oneclick
webclient+server for Ubuntu 22.04. This script does very little but it can make a server in 12 minutes or so. 
It's just a bash that automates installation of several things.

Fresh Ubuntu 22.04, open root, and type in command:  
git clone https://github.com/danomation/ragnarok_script.git && bash ragnarok_script/ragnarok.sh
